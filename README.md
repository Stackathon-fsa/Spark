# Spark

Spark is a mobile dating application inspired by Tinder!

## Using Spark

Spark currently is not deployed, so please feel free to fork the respository

## Installation 

npm install dependencies and use the command "expo start" to run the application on a mobile device simulator

```bash
expo start
```
## Setup

Application currently isn't deployed (in progress) so you must create a database on your system

```bash
createdb stackathon-tinder-clone
```

After connecting to the database you may be interested in seeding the database with some users

```bash
npm run seed
```

## Roadmap

In the near future there will be some additions to the current application, including "match" functionality and messaging between users
